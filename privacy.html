        <p><i>Effective Date: June 1, 2025</i></p>

    <!-- 1. Introduction -->
    <div id="privacy_1" class="section">
        <h1>1. Introduction</h1>
        <p>This Privacy Policy explains how WanProtector ("we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, and safeguards your information when you use our mobile application ("App"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring your data is handled securely.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- 2. Information We Collect -->
    <div id="privacy_2" class="section">
        <h1>2. Information We Collect</h1>
        <p>WanProtector does not collect or transmit any personally identifiable information. All data, including usernames, passwords, and vault contents, is securely stored on your device and never shared with the developer or third parties.</p>
        <p>We also use local storage to store user data securely on the device.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- 3. How We Use Your Information -->
    <div id="privacy_3" class="section">
        <h1>3. How We Use Your Information</h1>
        <p>We use the collected information (Master Password) for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To authenticate users and provide access to their secured data</li>
            <li>To ensure proper functioning and user experience of the app</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not send marketing emails, newsletters, or promotional communications.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- 4. Data Security and Storage -->
    <div id="privacy_4" class="section">
        <h1>4. Data Security and Storage</h1>
        <p>We implement strong, industry-standard encryption techniques to protect your data. All sensitive information, such as master password, entry's username, entry's password, and notes are encrypted using AES-256 in CBC mode, with a unique Initialization Vector (IV) generated for every encryption operation. This ensures that even identical data is encrypted differently each time.</p>
        <p>To maintain data integrity and prevent tampering, we apply HMAC-SHA256 authentication. Encryption keys are securely generated and stored on your device using platform-specific secure storage (Android Keystore or iOS Keychain). We never store plaintext passwords, and the developer has no access to your master password or any of your vault data.</p>
        <p>Your data remains strictly on your device. We do not use external analytics tools, advertising SDKs, or any form of tracking. If you choose to back up your encrypted data to Google Drive or another provider, it is done entirely at your discretion and remains unreadable by the developer.</p>
        <p>We also employ constant-time comparisons to guard against timing attacks and provide key backup functionality to support secure migration or recovery across devices.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- 5. Children’s Privacy -->
    <div id="privacy_5" class="section">
        <h1>5. Children’s Privacy</h1>
        <p>WanProtector is accessible to users under the age of 13. However, we strongly advise parental guidance when minors use password management tools. We do not knowingly collect more personal data than necessary and comply with child protection requirements under relevant laws.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- 6. Third-Party Services -->
    <div id="privacy_6" class="section">
        <h1>6. Third-Party Services</h1>
        <p>WanProtector stores all password data locally on your device. However, if you choose to enable backup functionality, you may opt to save your data to Google Drive or another cloud storage provider of your choice. This is entirely optional and user-initiated.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- 7. Policy Updates -->
    <div id="privacy_7" class="section">
        <h1>7. Policy Updates</h1>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. We encourage users to review this policy periodically. Updates will be posted within the app and, where appropriate, via user email.</p>
